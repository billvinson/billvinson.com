I have been going to Dragon Con every year (mostly - COVID caused ... issues) since 2012. In more recent years, I have been participating, in varying degrees, with a group called [Dragon Con Swag N Seek](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DragonConSwagNseek/) while at the convention. It's a group that encourages making/buying gifts to give away (the encouragement is towards selfless giving and random acts of kindness). Swag gifts could be anything (stickers, candy, toys, keepsakes, etc.) and they can be hidden/found anywhere within the convention space (5 host hotels) or you can give more directly by offering items at panels where con goers can take what interests them. I mostly stick to the former. It's a lot of fun as an added bonus during the convention. Sometimes you won't have any clue who found your swag and sometimes you might catch a glimpse of the find.

This year is my first year with a good & working 3D printer, so I've gone a bit overboard with my makings recently...

Here is what I'm currently planning to take, but there's a bit more than a week left so the list could grow ðŸ˜„ Some items I will have just a few (T-Rex skeleton as they're slow to print/assemble), whereas others I may have more than 100 items. The fidget clickers all have a blue keyboard switch inside to give it that "click".
