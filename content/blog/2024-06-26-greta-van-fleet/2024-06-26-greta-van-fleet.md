On our third day in Berlin, I decided to take advantage of an opportunity to go to a concert as the family had wanted to get dinner & relax, but I preferred seeing a bit more. I wasn't initially planning to, but had looked over possible options for the days of our trip. This opportunity jumped out at me to see [Greta Van Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Fleet). Yes, I liked their music, but the venue also caught my eye. The concert was being held in an old citadel/fortress, [Zitadelle Spandau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau_Citadel) dating back centuries. I wouldn't be afforded the opportunity to really check it all out, but I don't know how many chances I'll have in life to go see a concert inside a fortress dating back to the 1500s (completed in 1594). 

It really was interesting, but also familiar in that it's like going to see an outdoor concert anywhere in the US. There was food , but better as they had Bratwurst, lots of drink options and vendor sales. It was just the same experience, but put inside a great, old structure. I'm not sure why I thought the experience would be any different, but honestly, I had a blast.

I didn't get there as early as intended as it was a decently long ride out on the U-Bahn, but I still was in plenty of time to see the show. It was standing room only and I couldn't get very close to the stage, but still a great time. I got some bratwurst and drank some [Radler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy) while watching the show. Yes, it is a regional version of what we call a Shandy, but don't let that fool you, the Radler is vastly superior to my tastes.

The [setlist](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/greta-van-fleet/2024/zitadelle-spandau-berlin-germany-2babc4da.html) mostly held songs from their latest album, [Starcatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcatcher_(album)), and then a few from [The Battle at Garden Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_at_Garden%27s_Gate) and finally a couple of their biggest hits from one of their 2 early EPs, [From the Fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Fires).
